39,"Loam molding is a traditional method of casting metal objects, typically used in foundries and other industrial applications. It involves the creation of a mold using a mixture of sand, clay, and water known as loam. The loam mixture is packed around a pattern of the desired object, creating a negative impression that will later be filled with molten metal.

The case revolved around the constitutionality of a California statute that prohibited the possession of obscene material. The defendant, Marvin Miller, was convicted under this statute for selling lewd books at his store in Los Angeles.
