0,"Fire performance refers to the ability of a material or building component to resist and control the spread of fire. In Indonesia, fire performance is regulated by the National Building Code (NBC) and the National Building Material Standard (SNI). The NBC includes provisions for fire resistance in buildings, while SNI provides standards for fire-resistant materials such as steel, concrete, and wood.

Fire performance testing involves subjecting a material or building component to high temperatures and flame exposure to evaluate its ability to resist and control the spread of fire. This is done using standardized test methods and equipment, such as the UL 790 Standard for Fire Tests of Building Materials and Assemblies.

In Indonesia, fire performance testing is mandatory for buildings that exceed a certain height or area, and it is also required for materials used in construction, such as steel beams and concrete blocks. The results of these tests are then used to determine the fire resistance rating of the material or building component.
