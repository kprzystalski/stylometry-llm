This process involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle).

In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll and other pigments within the plant cells absorb sunlight, which excites their electrons to a higher energy level. These excited electrons are then transferred through a series of proteins in an electron transport chain, ultimately leading to the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Both ATP and NADPH are high-energy molecules that will be used later in the light-independent reactions.

This way, they can focus on testing the functionality and logic of their code, rather than its interactions with external services or databases.

Mockito simplifies the process of creating test doubles by providing a set of annotations (e.g., @Mock, @InjectMocks, and @Spy) that can be applied to class members or method parameters.

Additionally, Mockito offers a rich set of verification methods (e.g., verify, verifyZeroInteractions, and mockStatic) that allow developers to","[9, 4, 7, 1, 9, 9, 2, 13, 9, 14, 3, 17, 2, 9, 9, 1, 2, 13, 6, 13, 14]","Mockito is a popular mocking framework for Java applications, primarily used with testing frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG."
