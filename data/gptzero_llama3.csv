This freedom is enshrined in Article 29 of the Indonesian Constitution, which states that every citizen has the right to profess and practice their own religion. However, this right is limited to religious practices that are not deemed to be contrary to public order or morality.

96,"Here is an explanation of Turweston in plain text:

Turweston is a geological term used to describe a type of rock that forms from the cooling and solidification of magma deep within the Earth's crust. This process occurs when hot, molten rock (magma) rises to the surface and then cools slowly, allowing minerals to precipitate out of solution and form crystals. The resulting rock is called an igneous rock, with Turweston being a specific type that is characterized by its distinctive texture and composition. Turweston rocks are typically coarse-grained, meaning they have large mineral grains, and may display a range of colors including pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and black. The rock's appearance can vary depending on the temperature at which it cooled and the minerals present in the magma. Turweston is often found in areas where there has been significant volcanic activity, such as around volcanoes or in regions with a history of mountain-building. It can also form through contact metamorphism, where hot fluids from magma alter surrounding rocks. The name ""Turweston"" comes from the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire, England, where the rock was first described and named. In terms of its practical uses, Turweston is sometimes used as a building material due to its durability and attractive appearance.
