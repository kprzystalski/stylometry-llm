The inhabitants of both the city and the province are called Angevins or, more rarely, Angeriens. Angers proper covers and has a population of 152, 960 inhabitants, while around 422, 700 live in its metropolitan area (aire urbaine). The Angers Loire Metropole is made up of 29 communes covering with 296, 000 inhabitants (2017). Not including the broader metropolitan area, Angers is the third most populous commune in northwestern France after Nantes and Rennes and the 18th most populous commune in France. For centuries, Angers was an important stronghold in northwestern France. It was the cradle of the Plantagenet dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of Rene of Anjou. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the Mayenne, the Sarthe, and the Loir, all coming from the north and flowing south to the Loire. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the Maine, a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south. ",human,human,82

It went on:.""The surface is intersected by three nearly equidistant and parallel ranges of heights, the first of which, rising gradually from the river, has been long in a high state of cultivation, and contains several nursery grounds and gardens of great fertility. The valley between it and the second ridge is also fruitful, and is watered by the Cargen, which flows into the Nith. The second ridge, of greater elevation, produces excellent crops of turnips and potatoes, with wheat, barley, and oats; and the interval between it and the third ridge is partly good meadow land, but chiefly moss, which might at a moderate expense be brought into tillage.

It is located on the site of the historic Lehrter Bahnhof, and on the Berlin S-Bahn suburban railway. The station is operated by DB Station&Service, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG, and is classified as a Category 1 station, one of 21 in Germany and four in Berlin, the others being Berlin Gesundbrunnen, Berlin Sudkreuz and Berlin Ostbahnhof. Lehrter Bahnhof (Lehrte Station) opened in 1871 as the terminus of the railway linking Berlin with Lehrte, near Hanover, which later became Germany's most important east-west main line. In 1882, with the completion of the Stadtbahn (City Railway, Berlin's four-track central elevated railway line, which carries both local and main line services), just north of the station, a smaller interchange station called Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was opened to provide connections with the new line. This station later became part of the Berlin S-Bahn. In 1884, after the closure of nearby Hamburger Bahnhof (Hamburg Station), Lehrter Bahnhof became the terminus for trains to and from Hamburg. Following heavy damage during World War II, limited services to the main station were resumed, but then suspended in 1951. In 1957, with the railways to West Berlin under the control of East Germany, Lehrter Bahnhof was demolished, but Lehrter Stadtbahnhof remained as a stop on the S-Bahn. ",human,human,89
9,"Thomas Nuthall (died 7 March 1775) was an English politician and attorney who played an historic role in the ministries of William Pitt, Lord Bute, and Lord Rockingham. He was probably from Norfolk, and his first appointments came from Robert Walpole, who placed him in the Excise Office in 1740. By 1749, Nuthall was the receiver of hackney coaches. Horace Walpole used Nuthall to get Margaret Nicoll freed to marry George Walpole in 1751, but he thought Nuthall corrupt and mistrusted him. In 1757, Nuthall married Susan, the widow of his friend Hambleton Custance. By the time of his death, he had remarried, so the mother of Nuthall's legitimate son, Robert, could be either woman. (Nuthall had two bastard children as well.) William Pitt became Nuthall's protector and sponsor in the 1750s, and his connection to the family would remain steadfast. Generally, Nuthall was employed as an intermediary or ""ambassador"" between various political factions and Pitt. His first service in this regard was between Pitt and Thomas Pelham on bringing down Lord Bute's government. ",human,human,89

It was formed 26 million years ago during the Oligocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period. Geologists estimate it may be only a third of its original height due to intense erosion. Mount Beerwah has two peaks, the taller of which is high. It is one of the most visually prominent mountains in south-east Queensland. The first European settlers to ascend the peak were Andrew Petrie with his son John Petrie. Its name comes from the words ""birra, or ""sky, "" and ""wandum, "" ""climbing up."" In the traditional Aboriginal story of the region, Mount Beerwah is the pregnant mother and Mount Tibrogargan the father of all the other mountains in the area.

23,".Description.The Corrected d-exponent, also known as cd-exponent or more correctly dc-exponent (dc-exponent) as used in mud logging and formation pore pressure analysis in the oil industry, is an extrapolation of certain drilling parameters to estimate a pressure gradient for pore pressure evaluation while drilling. Normally this is done in over-pressured zones, but most mud logging contracts require it to be done at all times. It is regarded as one of the best tools for pore pressure evaluation. See mud log for an example of the corrected d-exponent plotted on a mud log. The parameter is an extension (""correction"", hence the ""c"" notation) to the d-exponent method previously used for estimating formation pore pressures. The extension consists of a correction for the mud weight in use, compared to ""standard"" mud for the region.. The parameters used to calculate dc-exponent values are: drilling rate (ROP), rotary speed, weight on bit, bit diameter and mud weight; it is plotted against drilled depth.. Theory. As a drill bit bores into rock, it will gradually encounter denser formations and therefore slower rates of penetration. (Though there are exceptions such as sands that normally drill faster, or faulted and uplifted formations).",human,human,76

25,"In Christian denominations that practice infant baptism, confirmation is seen as the sealing of the covenant created in baptism. Those being confirmed are known as confirmands. For adults, it is an affirmation of belief. Catholicism and Eastern Christianity view confirmation as a sacrament. In the East it is conferred immediately after baptism. In the West, this practice is usually followed when adults are baptized, but in the case of infants not in danger of death it is administered, ordinarily by a bishop, only when the child reaches the age of reason or early adolescence. Among those Christians who practice teen-aged confirmation, the practice may be perceived, secondarily, as a ""coming of age"" rite. In many Protestant denominations, such as the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist and Reformed traditions, confirmation is a rite that often includes a profession of faith by an already baptized person. Confirmation is required by Lutherans, Anglicans and other traditional Protestant denominations for full membership in the respective church. In Catholic theology, by contrast, it is the sacrament of baptism that confers membership, while ""reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace"".

Njimoluh was the son of Ibrahim Njoya, and he was educated in French, English, and the bamum script developed by his father. In 1931, in order to break the power of the Bamun, French administrators had exiled Ibrahim Njoya to Yaounde. The Bamum nobles had been scattered due to the French occupation, but they eventually chose Njimoluh from among Ibrahim Njoya's 177 children and reached an agreement with the French authorities.

This win was controversial because his car (nicknamed ""Calhoun"") spewing oil from a cracked overflow tank for many laps, which allegedly caused at least one driver to spin and crash. USAC officials put off black-flagging Jones after car owner J. C. Agajanian ran down pit lane and convinced them that the oil leak was below the level of a known crack and would not leak any further. Lotus owner Colin Chapman, whose English-built, rear-engined Lotus-Ford finished second in the hands of Scotsman Jim Clark, accused USAC officials of being biased in favor of the American driver and car. The non-black flagging of Jones remains controversial. Many, including Chapman and writer Brock Yates, believed that officials would have black flagged Jones if an American driver and car had been in second place instead of Clark in the British built Lotus, .

There were twelve tropical storms, a third of which became hurricanes. One of the hurricanes strengthened to the equivalent of a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy, which was also the most damaging storm of the season: it destroyed 15, 000 houses and left $40 million in damage in Puerto Rico. Betsy was also the deadliest of the season, having killed 18 people in the French West Indies, two from a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea, and 16 in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27 people. The season officially started on June 15, although an unnamed storm developed about a week prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June 12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico.

30,"The British Aerospace Sea Harrier is a naval short take-off and vertical landing/vertical take-off and landing jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft. It is the second member of the Harrier Jump Jet family developed. It first entered service with the Royal Navy in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS1 and became informally known as the ""Shar"". Unusual in an era in which most naval and land-based air superiority fighters were large and supersonic, the principal role of the subsonic Sea Harrier was to provide air defence for Royal Navy task groups centred around the aircraft carriers. The Sea Harrier served in the Falklands War and the Balkans conflicts; on all occasions it mainly operated from aircraft carriers positioned within the conflict zone. Its usage in the Falklands War was its most high profile and important success, when it was the only fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea Harriers shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict; 2 Sea Harriers were lost to enemy ground fire. They were also used to launch ground attacks in the same manner as the Harriers operated by the Royal Air Force. The Sea Harrier was marketed for sales abroad, but India was the only other operator after attempts to sell the aircraft to Argentina and Australia were unsuccessful. A second, updated version for the Royal Navy was made in 1993 as the Sea Harrier FA2, improving its air-to-air abilities and weapons compatibilities, along with a more powerful engine; this version was manufactured until 1998.

31,"Eta Aquarii, Latinized from Aquarii, is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Aquarius. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.04. The distance to this star, as determined by parallax measurements, is about. It is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of -8 km/s. Eta Aquarii is near the radiant of a meteor shower named after it. The stellar classification of Eta Aquarii is B9IV-Vn, which may indicate that it is beginning to evolve away from the main sequence into a subgiant as the supply of hydrogen at its core becomes exhausted. It is 65 million years old and is spinning rapidly with a high projected rotational velocity of 271 km/s. This rotation is causing an equatorial bulge, giving the star an oblate figure with a 24% larger radius at the equator than at the poles. The Doppler effect from the rapid rotation is causing the absorption lines in the star's spectrum to blur, as indicated by the 'n' suffix in the star's classification. Eta Aquarii has an estimated 2.96 times the mass of the Sun and 2.8 times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating 103 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 11, 042 K. ",human,human,89

The circuit business is now owned by Jonathan Palmer's MotorSport Vision organisation, and the surrounding Donington Park Estate, still owned by the Wheatcroft family, is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038. It has a capacity of 120, 000. Originally part of the Donington Hall estate, it was created as a racing circuit during the period between the First and Second World Wars when the German Silver Arrows were battling for the European Championship. Used as a military vehicle storage depot during the Second World War, it fell into disrepair until bought by local construction entrepreneur Tom Wheatcroft. Revived under his ownership in the 1970s, it hosted a single Formula One race in 1993, but became the favoured home of the British round of the MotoGP motorcycling championship. Leased by Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd in 2007 the hope that Formula One racing could return to the track, the incomplete venture failed to raise sufficient financial backing during the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. DVLL consequently lost the rights to the British rounds of both Formula 1 and MotoGP, and in its bankruptcy returned the track to the Wheatcroft family in December 2009.

The designation of southern New Jersey with a distinct toponym is a colloquial one rather than an administrative one, reflecting not only geographical but also perceived cultural differences from the northern part of the state, with no official definition. Though definitions of South Jersey may vary, most (if not all) of South Jersey is generally considered to be part of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area. Culturally, South Jersey is defined as the area in New Jersey within the influence of the Philadelphia metropolitan area (also known as the Delaware Valley), in contrast to the rest of New Jersey, located within the New York metropolitan area. New Jersey is sandwiched between the two large cities of New York on the northeast and Philadelphia at the southwest; Benjamin Franklin called the state ""a barrel tapped at both ends"". South Jersey may be defined geographically as the area below I-195, in particular the lower eight counties of New Jersey, whereas North Jersey is the area above Central Jersey.

44,"Cnidaria is a phylum under kingdom Animalia containing over 11, 000 species of aquatic animals found both in freshwater and marine environments, predominantly the latter. Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. Cnidarians mostly have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, with many species having complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage, and the parasitic classes evolved to have neither form. ",human,human,59

46,"Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from the sex that they were assigned at birth. Some transgender people who desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another identify as transsexual. Transgender, often shortened as trans, is also an umbrella term; in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may also include people who are non-binary or genderqueer. Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. The term transgender may be defined very broadly to include cross-dressers. Being transgender is distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender people may identify as heterosexual (straight), homosexual (gay or lesbian), bisexual, asexual, or otherwise, or may decline to label their sexual orientation. The opposite of transgender is cisgender, which describes persons whose gender identity matches their assigned sex. The degree to which individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity has been called transgender congruence.

It was invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues.   It is an example of a complex nonlinear oscillator of interest in control system theory.   The pendulum is underactuated and extremely non-linear due to the gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the Coriolis and centripetal forces.   Since then, dozens, possibly hundreds of papers and theses have used the system to demonstrate linear and non-linear control laws.   The system has also been the subject of two texts.. Equations of motion.Despite the great deal of attention the system has received, very few publications successfully derive (or use) the full dynamics.   Many authors have only considered the rotational inertia of the pendulum for a single principal axis (or neglected it altogether).   In other words, the inertia tensor only has a single non-zero element (or none), and the remaining two diagonal terms are zero.

Ludi were held in conjunction with, or sometimes as the major feature of, Roman religious festivals, and were also presented as part of the cult of state. The earliest ludi were horse races in the circus (ludi circenses). Animal exhibitions with mock hunts (venationes) and theatrical performances (ludi scaenici) also became part of the festivals. Days on which ludi were held were public holidays, and no business could be conducted--""remarkably, "" it has been noted, ""considering that in the Imperial era more than 135 days might be spent at these entertainments"" during the year. Although their entertainment value may have overshadowed religious sentiment at any given moment, even in late antiquity the ludi were understood as part of the worship of the traditional gods, and the Church Fathers thus advised Christians not to participate in the festivities. The singular form ludus, ""game, sport"" or ""play"" has several meanings in Latin. The plural is used for ""games"" in a sense analogous to the Greek festivals of games, such as the Panhellenic Games. The late-antique scholar Isidore of Seville, however, classifies the forms of ludus as gymnicus (""athletic""), circensis (""held in the circus, "" mainly the chariot races), gladiatorius (""gladiatorial"") and scaenicus (""theatrical""). The relation of gladiatorial games to the ludi is complex; see Gladiator. ",human,human,89
53,"The Geology of Puerto Rico ""can be divided into three major geologic provinces: The Cordillera Central, the Carbonate, and the Coastal Lowlands."" Puerto Rico is composed of Jurassic to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, which are overlain by younger Oligocene to recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks. Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern Oligocene to recent carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. These rocks may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm. During the Carboniferous period, Puerto Rico was submerged. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates. This means that it is currently being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by the interaction of these plates. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean.

55,"Khanom khai hong , formerly known as khanom khai hia , is a kind of Thai dessert. It may be considered as a Thai-style doughnut balls.

Its taste is sweet, salty; crispy outside, but soft inside. Its name literally means ""swan-egg snack"", due to its shape looks like a swan egg. It is said that during the early Rattanakosin Kingdom, the King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I) was a person who liked to eat water monitor eggs. But at one time, it was not the season in which water monitors laid eggs, therefore the eggs could not be found. Royal Concubine Waen  therefore invented this dessert in order to serve the King. So it was called khanom khai hia according to what it replaced. Later, it was renamed to khanom khai hong as in the present, because water monitors and their Thai name, in the belief of Thai people, are related to bad and evil things. ",human,human,89
56,"The Inter-American Democratic Charter was adopted on 11 September 2001 by a special session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, held in Lima, Peru. It is an inter-American instrument with the central aim of strengthening and upholding democratic institutions in the nations of the Americas. The Charter, which is binding on all 34 of the currently active OAS member states, spells out what democracy entails and specifies how it should be defended when it is under threat.. Background .Beginning in the 1980s, and especially after the Cold War, as international interest in multilateral action in support of human rights and democracy resulted in several conventions and treaties at the United Nations and other regional organizations of states, the Organization of American States held a series of diplomatic conferences on the issue of democracy. Democracy is one of the foundational principles of the OAS, and it was enshrined in its charter from the beginning. In 1985, the Protocol of Cartagena de Indias strengthened the charter's original language on democracy by asserting that ""representative democracy is an indispensable condition for the stability, peace and development of the region"" and ""[t]he solidarity of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require the political organization of those States on the basis of the effective exercise of representative democracy"". However, the charter also exhorts the organization to promote democracy ""with due respect for the principle of nonintervention,"" and lacks any mechanism for collective action among the states in defense of democracy. . The Carter Center’s Americas Program advised the Organization of American States on the development of the document.   The General Assembly special session in Lima at which the Democratic Charter was adopted was the reason why United States Secretary of State Colin Powell was absent from his country during the Al-Qaeda terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001; he cut short his participation at the meeting and departed Lima for Washington, D.C., shortly after midday..

57,"Yitzchok (Isaac) Hutner (; 1906-1980) was an American Orthodox rabbi and rosh yeshiva (dean). Originally from Warsaw, Hutner first studied the Torah in Slabodka. He then traveled to Mandatory Palestine where he became a student of Abraham Isaac Kook, and narrowly escaped the 1929 Hebron massacre. After this, Hutner returned to Europe, where he befriended Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, maintaining friendships with both long after they had all established their own institutions in the United States. Hutner was the long-time dean of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, New York, an older institution that grew under his leadership. Hutner's pedagogic style was a blend of the Hasidic and Misnagdic elements of his own family's origins. His discourses, called ma'amarim, contained elements of a Talmudic discourse, a Hasidic Tish and a philosophic lecture. Although his title was rosh yeshiva, Hutner's leadership style more closely resembled that of a rebbe who expected fealty from his followers. In his later years, Hutner established Yeshiva Pachad Yitzchok in Jerusalem, which is named after his own magnum opus. On one of his trips there, Hutner's plane was seized by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorists in the Dawson's Field hijackings, which he survived. ",human,human,89

The coup had been ordered by the military Junta in Greece and staged by the Cypriot National Guard in conjunction with EOKA- B. It deposed the Cypriot president Archbishop Makarios III and installed Nikos Sampson. The aim of the coup was the union (enosis) of Cyprus with Greece, and the Hellenic Republic of Cyprus to be declared. The Turkish forces landed in Cyprus on 20 July and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a civilian government. Following the breakdown of peace talks, another Turkish invasion in August 1974 resulted in the capture of approximately 36% of the island. The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line. Around 150, 000 people (amounting to more than one-quarter of the total population of Cyprus, and to one-third of its Greek Cypriot population) were expelled from the northern part of the island, where Greek Cypriots had constituted 80% of the population.

67,"A glacial erratic is glacially deposited rock differing from the type of rock native to the area in which it rests. Erratics, which take their name from the Latin word errare (to wander), are carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometres. Erratics can range in size from pebbles to large boulders such as Big Rock in Alberta. Geologists identify erratics by studying the rocks surrounding the position of the erratic and the composition of the erratic itself. Erratics are significant because: *They can be transported by glaciers, and they are thereby one of a series of indicators which mark the path of prehistoric glacier movement. Their lithographic origin can be traced to the parent bedrock, allowing for confirmation of the ice flow route. *They can be transported by ice rafting. This allows quantification of the extent of glacial flooding resulting from ice dam failure which release the waters stored in proglacial lakes such as Lake Missoula. Erratics released by ice-rafts that were stranded and subsequently melt, dropping their load, allow characterization of the high-water marks for transient floods in areas like temporary Lake Lewis. *Erratics dropped by icebergs melting in the ocean can be used to track Antarctic and Arctic-region glacial movements for periods prior to record retention.

This event ended 156 years of British rule in the former colony. Hong Kong was reestablished as a special administrative region of China, and partially continues to maintain its economic and governing systems distinct from those of mainland China. With the passing of the 2020 Hong Kong national security law, the mainland Chinese government has begun to pare back the independence of the Hong Kong governance. The law assigned judiciary power over cases related to the law to judges that are selected by the Beijing government, which has reduced the scope of Hong Kong's judicial independence. The law stipulates that complicated cases may be tried in mainland China, which enables the mainland government to ensure that such cases fall under its purview. In practice, the law has been used to limit speech and actions that may be seen as critical of the mainland government or as supportive of Hong Kong independence. Hong Kong had been a colony of the British Empire since 1842, after the First Opium War, and its territory was expanded on two occasions; in 1860 with the addition of Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island, and again in 1898 when Britain obtained a 99-year lease for the New Territories.

It was driven by Ricardo Rosset and rookie Toranosuke Takagi. This was Tyrrell's last year in F1, as Ken Tyrrell had sold the team to British American Racing prior to the first race. Paul Stoddart had almost bought the team prior to BAR's takeover, but the deal was done. Nevertheless, Stoddart's European Aviation sponsored the team and provided transportion during the season. Tyrrell left the team soon afterward BAR's takeover in anger, after Rosset was chosen to drive alongside Takagi, rather than Tyrrell driver Jos Verstappen. The team had a V10 engine and a reasonable chassis, but the season was seen as a holding year before BAR took over in. The car retained the tower sidepod mounted wings introduced by Tyrrell the year before. The wings had been copied by other teams but were banned partway into the season. The team was also disadvantaged by having an over-eager rookie in Takagi, who nevertheless showed flashes of potential, and Rosset, who proved to be too slow. ",human,human,89
78,"The Musconetcong River is a tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. It flows through the rural mountainous country of northwestern New Jersey. Part of it is a National Wild and Scenic River. It rises out of Lake Hopatcong, on the border between Sussex and Morris counties. It flows through Lake Musconetcong, then flows southwest, past Stephensburg and New Hampton, passing south of Washington then along the southeastern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge. It joins the Delaware at Riegelsville, approximately 10 mi (16 km) south of Phillipsburg. The river does not flow through any large population center and has been the site of relatively little industrial development throughout its history. In the 18th century, the surrounding hills were largely deforested as a source of charcoal for the iron industry in the surrounding region. The local industry declined by the middle of the 19th century after the building of the former Morris Canal, the course of which ran along the upper river, to bring coal from Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. After the demise of the canal from the introduction of railroads in the late 19th century, the dam pools along the river that supplied the canal became the site of a popular summer cottage industry.

The book was released in late 2004 following the cancellation of the television show Firefly. Jane Espenson was a writer for the show and the book contains a series of essays that discuss the show from a variety of viewpoints, some scholarly, others with a comedic note. As well as answering unresolved plotlines and character arcs, the compilation includes insight into the filming of each episode with actress Jewel Staite (who played the role of Kaylee Frye on the show) providing a commentary on each of the episodes produced. Due to Firefly's early demise it left viewers with unanswered questions and a certain sense of loss. The essays attempt to resolve the unanswered questions brought up in the show, ranging from the origin of the Reavers, the multi-racial casting, and the use of the Chinese language. Some essays are existentialist, seeking to define what freedom meant for each member of the crew, a theme that Joss Whedon seemed to be exploring. Others focus on the changing nature of sexual relationships in Whedon's vision of the future.
