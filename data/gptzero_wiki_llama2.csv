47," The Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where the observation of a system can effectively ""freeze"" its evolution, preventing it from changing states. This effect is named after the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, who proposed several paradoxes related to motion and change. 
The QZE occurs due to the collapse of the wave function when an observation is made. When a quantum system is observed, its wave function collapses into one of its eigenstates, effectively stopping the system from evolving further. 
This effect has been experimentally demonstrated in various systems, including trapped ions and superconducting qubits. It has also been proposed as a potential method for controlling quantum systems and preventing decoherence, which is the loss of quantum information due to interaction with the environment. 
The QZE can be seen as an extension of the more well-known Observer Effect",llama2,ai,0.9997932945046397

80," The World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theory is an alternative explanation for the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7 during the September 11 attacks in 2001. According to this theory, explosives were planted inside the buildings by government agents or other perpetrators, causing them to implode at near-freefall speed. Proponents of this theory argue that the collapse of the buildings was too sudden and symmetrical to be explained by fire and structural damage alone, suggesting that pre-positioned explosive charges were used to bring down the structures in a controlled manner. They also point to various pieces of evidence they believe support their claims, such as molten metal seen at the site, unreacted nano-thermite found in dust samples, and eyewitness accounts of explosions before the collapses.

This can lead to an overestimation of the severity of the harm caused by inaction, and underestimation of the benefits that could have been achieved through taking a different course of action. The term was first coined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their 1984 paper ""Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.""
Omission bias has been observed in various contexts, including healthcare decision-making, environmental policy, and personal relationships. It is thought to be a result of people's tendency to focus on the negative aspects of situations, as well as their desire for closure and certainty.
