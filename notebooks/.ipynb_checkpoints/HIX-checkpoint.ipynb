    "text = \"The list of Swedish royal consorts refers to the wives and husbands of the monarchs who have ruled Sweden throughout its history. The earliest recorded consort was Queen Enheduanna, the wife of King Erik VII, in the 12th century. She is known to have played a significant role in state affairs during her husband's reign. In the Middle Ages, consorts were often queens dowager or princesses who married into the Swedish royal family. The first queen consort to hold significant influence was Queen Margaret Valdemarsdottir, wife of King Magnus IV, who served as regent for her son-in-law during his minority. The 17th century saw a rise in consorts' influence, with notable examples including Queen Hedvig Eleonora and Queen Ulrika Eleonora. In the modern era, consorts have continued to play important roles in Swedish royal life, with notable figures including King Gustaf V's wife, Queen Victoria, and King Carl XVI Gustaf's wife, Queen Silvia. The current king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, is married to Queen Silvia, who has been a prominent supporter of her husband during his reign. Throughout its history, the list of Swedish royal consorts reflects the evolving role and influence of women in Swedish monarchy.\"\n",

It is commonly known as the \"Golden Pebble Moth\" or \"Golden Scale Moth.\" This small, golden-colored moth is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America. The larvae of Pseudotelphusa scalella feed on lichen, which they scrape off from rocks and other surfaces using their specialized mouthparts. They are considered a pest by some because they can damage the protective layer of lichens on rock faces, potentially leading to erosion. However, they also play an important role in the ecosystem as a food source for birds and other predators. The adult moths have a wingspan of about 15-20 mm and are usually active during the day. They can be found flying around rocks and cliffs where their preferred food source is abund\n",

      "Fast cutting is a technique used in film editing to create a sense of urgency or excitement by rapidly switching between shots. This style can be seen in action films, thrillers, and other genres that aim to keep the audience engaged and on the edge of their seats. Fast cutting involves using short shot durations, often less than a second, to transition from one scene to another. The rapid pace of these cuts can make it difficult for viewers to process what they are seeing, adding to the overall intensity of the film. Some directors use fast cutting as a storytelling tool, while others may employ it simply for its visual appeal. Fast cutting is often contrasted with slow motion, which involves stretching out a shot's duration to create a sense of drama or suspense. Both techniques can be used effectively in different contexts, depending on the filmmaker's intent and the desired effect on the audience.\n",

      "The World Trade Center (WTC) was destroyed on September 11, 2001, when two hijacked airplanes crashed into the towers, causing them to collapse.

This theory has been widely discredited by experts in engineering, physics, and materials science.
